            How does this work?<br>
        </div>
        <div class="generalInfoInfo">
            First, you upload your resume (in either PDF or DOCX format.)<br><br>
            Next, you answer some questions about yourself and your job search - for example: are you willing to relocate? Are you looking for full- or part-time work?<br><br> 
            Finally, all that information is encoded into information that the AI can read and digest. That encoded information is stored here on our servers.<br><br>
            You will receive a personalized link to your own personal chatbot.<br><br>
            When someone visits that link, your encoded personal info is sent to an AI instance and a chatbot is started.<br><br>
            Your visitor can then ask questions about you, your job history, and other personal info, and the AI can answer them based on your information.<br><br>
            Think of it like the introductory chat that you have with any recruiter or hiring manager.<br><br>
            This saves both you and the other person time, since they can find out if your skills and other job preferences align with what they're looking for.<br><br>
            And they can do that 24 hours a day, without having to find a time that works for both of you.<br><br>
            Visit the &nbsp;<a href="examples"><font style="color: blue; font-size: 24px">EXAMPLES</font></a> &nbsp;page to see what the chatbot interaction is like.

        <div class="generalInfoSubtitleHeading">
            What sort of information do you ask for?<br>
        </div>
        <div class="generalInfoInfo">
            The usual information you'd share with a recruiter or hiring manager. Things like:<br><br>
            Are you looking for full or part time work? Willing to accept contract gigs?<br><br>
            Are you willing to relocate?<br><br>
            Are you willing to travel for work?<br><br>
            What are your salary expectations? (You can leave this one blank if you like.)<br><br><br><br>
            In addition, you can answer questions about favorite past projects you've worked on, what job titles you're interested in, and so on.<br><br>
            You can leave any question blank, and the AI will simply inform the questioner that it does not have access to that information, and that they should get in touch with you.<br><br> 
        </div>

        <div class="generalInfoSubtitleHeading">
            Is my information safe?<br>
        </div>
        <div class="generalInfoInfo">
          Your information is as safe as anything uploaded to a job-seeking site like Monster.com or Dice.com.<br><br>
          In fact, since the only people with access to your information are those with your personalized link, one could argue your information is <b>more</b> secure.<br><br>
            We do not store passwords locally, and there is no identifying information in the personalized link you are given.<br><br>
            Of course, once you share it, anyone with that link can find out anything that is on your resume.<br><br>
                No payment information of any kind is stored on our servers, as payment processing is handled by Stripe, a well-respected third-party payment processing entity.<br><br>
        </div>

        <div class="generalInfoSubtitleHeading">
            How much does it cost?<br>
        </div>
        <div class="generalInfoInfo">
            We know that when you're looking for work, you often need to watch every penny.<br><br>
            That's why the basic version of the application is a mere <font style="color: green">$9(US)</font> per month.<br><br> 
            You'll receive a personalized link to your chatbot, with unlimited sharing and chatting with as many recruiters and hiring managers as you like.<br><br>
            For those who want a little more functionality, a deluxe version of the application is coming soon.<br><br>
            This will allow users to share online portfolios, including videos (such as YouTube videos) and other websites.<br><br>
            Questioners will be able to ask about those external sources as well.<br><br>
