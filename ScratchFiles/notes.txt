Once you SUBMIT from editInfo.html page (for the first time):

Resume information (from PDF or DOCX) is extracted into text - resume_info.txt.
Answers to questions are converted to sentences.
Those sentences are appended to resume_info.txt.
resume_info.txt is then stored in the database.
For queries, resume_info.txt is retrieved from the db and added to a chromadb collection using embedding function.

If SUBMITTING from editInfo.html (subsequent times):
If new resume is uploaded:
    ALERT user that he/she should scroll to the bottom and press SUBMIT, changing anything necessary along the way
    Once SUBMIT is pressed, it's just like its's being submitted for the first time
If no new resume is uploaded:



token_split_texts is a list of the information in First Last's resume
first_last_chroma_collection is the chroma collection for that list, with embeddings
need to append the following:

character_split_texts is a list of information in Homer's resume
homer_simpson_chroma_collection is the collection for homer's list, with embeddings
Need to append:


Things to do:

Edit DB: 
    I want extracted resume text kept separate, in addition to the combined "info" cell
    This will allow me to change just the text if the customer uploads a new resume but leaves everything else the same

Set "login" to 1 (state? session?) when user is logged in
    Set to zero after certain amount of inactivity? No?
